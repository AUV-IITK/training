The 555 timer IC has 3 modes- monostable, astable, bistable. I have used the astable mode so that the output fluctuates for a square wave output.
The 50% duty cycle is symmetric.
Pin 2 and 6 are connected to bring about oscillations.
The resistors 2 and 3 are connected to discharge pin 7.
The capacitor and battery are grounded through pin 1.
Resistor 1 ensures that the capacitor is fully charged.
The pin 3 is connected to the positive terminal of the LED since it provides output current.
