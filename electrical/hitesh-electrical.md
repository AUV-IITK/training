Learnt about different modes of 555 timer IC.
In this case we use astable mode which produces square wave.
Next I learnt about the working of the circuit and about duty cycle.
Next applying different values for capacitor and resistors to get approx 50% duty cycle.
Then with the help of potentiometer changing the frequency of the blinking of led
