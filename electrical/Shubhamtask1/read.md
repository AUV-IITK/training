Explanation:

Initially the circuit without diodes  consists of two resistance R1 and R2 and capacitor C . Then t1(oscillator charge ) is given
by t1=0.693(R1+R2)C and t2 (capacitor discharge)  by t2=0.693R2C.
Thereby total time T=t1+t2 and duty=t1/T*100.
After connecting diode capacitor charges through R1 as R2 is shorted while  during discharge capacitor dischages through R2.
Thus duty reduces to R1/(R1+R2)
on choosing R1=R2 duty can be made 50%.
