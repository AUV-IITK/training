## This is what I learned-
1) There are 3 modes of 555 timer IC and the one used here is the **astable** mode.
2) By adjusting the values of resistors and capacitors we can control the frequency of LED
3) Th=0.7*(R1+R2)*C1- time for which LED is ON
4) Tl=0.7*R2*C1- time for which LED is off
5) so by  using a variable resistance (potentiometer) in place of R1 we can control the frequency of LED.
