**Electrical task one**

**Link for my project-**_ https://www.tinkercad.com/things/2tTJUKOQHqE-adding-components/editel?lessonid=EM7TI4PIXKPYN1R&projectid=OIYJ88OJ3OPN3EA&collectionid=OIYJ88OJ3OPN3EA&sharecode=dd426PIpByROuillbcvRF7rPNX4PZ-q4ij8bOFTsGkY _

**Procedure:**-I used a 9V battery to power the circuit, I connected it to the 555 timer .I used two 1 k-Ohm resistors and one 500 k-Ohm resistor. Further,I used a red led and one capactior( 10 microFarad ).I mounted the whole circuit on a breadboard.Following this I used the "Start Simulation " option on TinkerCAD. 


**Software task two**

**Work done**- After attending the live tutorials on ROS by the team heads,I went through the slides of ROS tutorials by  robotics club and also the tutorials given on the official ROS website.I was unable to complete the assignment as I took a lot of time going through the tutorials .Further I was unable to devote a decent amount of time to AUV ,as I had 4 quizzes this week(ESC,PHY,MTH and CHM102).
