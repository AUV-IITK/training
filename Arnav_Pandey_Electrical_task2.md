## Task Description-
We were supposed to create a 4 bit binary counter IC on tinkerCAD.
## Procedure-
During the task I learnt that the binary counter is used to count by lighting up LEDs in a pattern decided by the frequency modulator.In binary number system numbers used are as follows:- Decimal number System  | Corresponding number in binary number sys.
         1                         0000
         2                         0010
         3                         0110
         4                         0100
                                       and so on....
 *Note- In this task we were supposed to use 4 bits only so 4 LEDs(corresponding to 2^n where 1<=n<=4)are used.Each LED swithces ON whenever '1' is assigned to its corresponding bit and OFF when the same is assigned '0'.*

 I used a 5 V power supply,4 different coloured LEDs(for main count),4 resistors (of 250 ohm each),a frequency modulator(working on square function) and a single LED(and a corresponding resistor of 250 ohm) to indicate the frequency.
