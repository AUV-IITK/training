Regarding assignment-2(ros+pid):
I have completed the ros part of the assignment (in sahil_ros/task1/ folder) after 4-5 days of giving the assignment.
But i had not done the pid part because:
1) initially i searched a lot how to write pid controller code, but could not understand how to convert physical equations to the form required for pid controller.
2) I had not given mid-sem(as my father was suffering from covid), so my makeup midsem started along with quizzes. and I didnot gave much time to pid from thereon.
3) I watched all lectures provided for pid but still not able to figure out, how to write code for it.
