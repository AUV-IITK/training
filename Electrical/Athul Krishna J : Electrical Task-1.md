The resistors connected  in 6,7,8 terminals of 555 timers are R1 and R2.

The duty cycle % is the % of totalm time for which the led is on ..

Formula is given by [(R1+R2)/(R1+2R2)]*100 .

If R1 >>> R2 then duty cycle becmes 100% 

If R2 >>> R1 then duty cycle becomes 50 % , which is what we need ..
