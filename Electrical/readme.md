### Electrical task 1
#### blinking LED with 50% duty using a 555 timer
##### Components used:
      1. 555 timer
      2. Two 1K ohm resistors
      3. One 20k ohm potentiometer for controlling the frquency of blinking
      4. Two capacitors ( 0.01 uF and 20 uF )
      
Since duty is given by R1+R2/(R1+2R2), to make it equal to 50% i used 
R2>>R1(R2 is the potentiometer). Also by varying the resistance of the or by chaging the value of capacitance
The frequency of blinking can be adjusted accordingly.
