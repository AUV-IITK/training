The 555 timer IC is an integrated circuit used in a variety of timer, delay, pulse generation, and oscillator applications. It is basically used to create time delay.
Blinking frequency can be adjusted by changing resistance of 2 resistors
Potientiometer can be used to se the relation of on time and off time.Potentiometer will change value of its resistance and therefore one can se the change in on of time in led.
50% duty means 50 % output making 2 resistors equal makes sure 50% output
