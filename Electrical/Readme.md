## Approach
1. I first looked up the basic working principle of a 555 IC and its operating modes (Bistable, Monostable and Astable modes).
2. Looked up the basic schematic of a 555 Timer in Astable mode and learnt how to adjust the Duty Cycle and Frequency.
3. Built the circuit with bare components to get an idea and tweaked with the values of Resistances and Capacitances.
4. Built the final circuit on a Breadboard for a tidier circuit.
