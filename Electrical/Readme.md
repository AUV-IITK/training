MY SUBMISSION FOR ELECTRICAL TASK 1.

To Design a 555 timer circuit which blinks a LED with 50% duty cycle using Tinkercad

I used the astable mode of 555 Timer IC which allows to generate oscillating potential.
For making 50% duty cycle, I used a Diode in parallel with resistor(pin 6-7).
To control the blinking rate, I used a potentiometer in place of resistor(pin 7-8).
