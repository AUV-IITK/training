# Designing a *555 timer circuit* using **TinkerCad**

The 555 has three main operating mode : *Monostable, Astable, and Bistable*. Each mode represents a different type of circuit that has a particular output.
For this assignment, I have tried making the circuit in the **Astable operating mode** beacuse using this mode we can generate outputs analogous to square wave oscillations/clock pulse. 


## The Approach:
This mode is self triggering and changes its state automatically from high to low and low and high. This is achieved by shorting the 
threshold and trigger pin.
The other connections can be seen in the snapshot. The capacitor charges and discharges between 2/3 Vcc and 1/3 Vcc limits. This 
cycle continuous and we get high-low-high-low output continuously at the rate of charging and discharging of capacitor.


## The Bonus part:
I have also tried varying the current in the circuit using a *photoresistor* which acts as a variable resistance here. As a result, we could influence the frequency of LED blinks by varying the resistance provided by the photoresistor.
