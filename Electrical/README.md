[555 Timer Circuit](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/2Z2OQxuMoN3)

#### Approach :

- Using the 'Astable' mode of the the 555 Timer IC.
- Changing the values of the resistors to control the frequency of the LED.
- T1=0.693 * (R1+R2) * C1 -Time for which LED is ON.
- T=0.693 * (R1+2R2) * C1 -Total time period.
- Duty= T1/T * 100
- Potentiometer to be used for changing the blinking frequency of the LED.
