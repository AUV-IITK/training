The components used in this circuit are a 555 timer IC, 3 resistors (2 1kohm each, and 1 100kohm), 2 capacitors, and a battery. 
The circuit has a few basic connections(grounding and battery connections).
This RC circuit is arranged in such a way that the 'ON' time and the 'OFF' time are determined by the values of capacitors and resistors.
Higher the capacitance, lower the frequency; higher the resistance, lower the frequency.
The load resistor charges and discharges the capacitor. Whereas the two other resistors decide the on and off time frequencies of the circuit.
