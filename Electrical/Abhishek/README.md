## Design a 555 timer circuit which blinks a LED with 50% duty cycle

1. Read about how a 555 IC and its operation mode, here we had to use the astable mode.
2. Setup the circuit, using a breadboard, did the Tinkercad tutorial to understand how breadboards work (had to refer some youtube channel for this).
3. We can change the blinking frequency of the LED by changing the Capacitor value (attached between ground and trigger) and the large resistor value (at threshold).
4. A large value of resistor at threshold helps us to achieve a duty cycle of nearly 50% (by the formula for duty cycle given [here](https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/waveforms/555_oscillator.html)).
