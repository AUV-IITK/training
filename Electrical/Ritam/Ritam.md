### Approach
I first read about what exactly is an 555 oscillator and the significance of 50% duty cycle.
Then I completed some tutorials to get familiar with tinkercad.
Next I followed instructions to mak the circuit. I ran into many hiccups, it took some time to figure out how the borad worked and where to attach the wires.
Lastly I had to look up the resistors' and capacitor's value so as to get the correct duty cycle.(Earlier mine was too slow is blinking)>
