# Hi, This is Parth Maniar.
# Task is to create 555 timer in tinkercad

## What i have done
1 I watched youtube tutorial of tinkercad on how to use it.
2 Then I read about 555 timer. It is an integrated circuit (chip) used in oscillator applications.
3 Then in the circuit to control the frequency of LED, i adjusted the values of resistors and capacitors to get desired frequency
4 Potentiometer is used to control the time period for both the on cycle and off cycle can be independently adjusted allowing full control over the duty cycle without affecting the output frequency.
