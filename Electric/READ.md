#OBSERVATIONS      
                  1.  For sufficiently large value of R2 frequency only depends upon the value of R1 and C1.
                  2.  More the value of resistance(R2) more quickly it reaches the stable frequency value.
                  3.  Frequency is given by f=1/(0.7*2*R1*C1) .
                  4.  Now we can attach potentiometer in place of R1 and use it as a rheostat and observe how the frequency changes.

NOTE : The above observations are for 555 oscillator with 50% duty cycle.

Requied components- Two resistors, two capacitors, breadboard, battery, 555, LED.

#Steps         
         1. Connect terminal1 of R1 to trigger and terminal2 to output.
         2. Connect terminal1 of R1 and threshold to terminal1 of R2.
         3. Connect terminal2 of R2 to reset, power and positive terminal of the battery.
         4. Connect ground to negative terminal of the battery.
         5. Connect terminal1 of R2 to terminal1 of C1 and connect terminal2 of C1 to ground and terminal1 of C2.
         6. Connect terminal2 of C2 to control voltage.
         7. Finally connect anode of LED to output and cathode to ground.
