# Task list

## Task 1

Solve the first 10 problems at [OverTheWire games](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/).
Write down the solutions (code+what command you learnt) in a properly formatted Markdown file. I'll tell where to upload it. 
This assignment is just to teach you googling fast; please don't ask among each other - not helpful for you. There are multiple "tutorials" present on Medium/blog sites; avoid that; it's awesome to learn things on your own

Deadline for this is tomorrow 2 PM. If someone finishes early, continue to whatever level you like.
